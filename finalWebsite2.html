<p>These are some pictures of rappers that I listen to and why I like them. Disclaimer some of these rappers suck, but they have something about them that makes there music good.</p>

<p>This is my dad, and he is a rapper. No not a candy wrapper; A rapper. he's really good here is a link to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IamFrankiePayne">Youtube</a>. He's my biggest role model and I try to be more like him everyday. Most times falling short. my dad has always had nearly impeccable discipline, has always been confident, brave, and trustworthy. Unfortunately these traits haven't fully rubbed on me. His music is also done with complete talent and passion. I truly love my dad.</p>

<p>Speaking of Rappers this is another one. His name is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLQPinZNWKlLBF7C_m2YP3g">Yung Gravy</a>, and he a rapper I have been recently listening to. the instrumentals he use are always high quality, and they make the music that much better to listen to. Yung Gravy's rhymes are not that great, and the topic always seems to be about flexing. Anyway I like his music mostly because of his producers not him exactly. never the less his musics alright.</p>
