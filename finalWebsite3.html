<h1>My Fav Games</h1>

<div id="rightBody">

<p>These are some of my favorite games to play on my down time (and sometimes when I should be doing work). These games are either Made very well, Are really fun to play, or have made me laugh.</p>
<h2>The Walking Dead</h2>
<img id="gravy" src="WalkingDead_afp.jpg"alt="twd">
<p>I like this game because it is very story driven and makes the game play very immersive. I usually have to play this game when I have absolutely nothing to do, because it takes me a long time to play levels because of all the things you can do.</p>
<h2>Super Smash Bros</h2>
<img id="gravy" src="h2x1_nswitch_supersmashbrosultimate_02_image1600w.jpg"alt="ssb">
<p>I don't think that anyone that i know has said they don't like smash bros. It's one of the most fun fighting games that I have ever played, and it's very easy to pick up(hard to master). I'd like to take this time to hype up <a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/">Super Smash Brothers</a> Ultimate by linking the official website</p>
